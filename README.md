# Weapon_for_Hero-OOP_Project
Weapon for Hero is a Java object-oriented project we did in class. The game works by using inheritance of multiple class objects like weapon and character. The game works by starting the player with a set strength, hit points, and manna. The player then has the option to choose between three weapons: Bow and Arrow, Fork of Death, and Jerry teh Frog. Each weapon has disadvantages and advantages. All weapons have a basic attack and a special attack that varies. Once the player has selected their weapo of choice, they must battle the goblin. After each round, their stats are displayed on the console as well as the goblin's stats. The game is completed when either the player dies or the goblin dies. To play the game, download all of the files and run the GameDriver.java file.
